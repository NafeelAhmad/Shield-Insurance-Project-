## **About Company:**
Shield Insurance is famous for giving solid protection, keeping people safe from life's uncertainties. Their commitment to reliable coverage makes them stand out in the industry.

**Dataset:**
We've compiled data covering the period from November 2022 to April 2023 across six diverse cities. The dataset encompasses individuals ranging from 18 to 65+, and our focus is on selling nine unique policies through four distinct sales channels.

## **General View:**
In the realm of Insurance sales, Delhi stands out by generating a substantial revenue of 401 million, surpassing that of five other cities. This accomplishment can be attributed to a remarkable customer base of 11,007.

March 2023 shines as a standout month, boasting increased revenue, higher insurance sales, and a larger customer base compared to other months. This reflects a peak in performance during this period.

An interesting trend emerges as the city's revenue is directly proportional to its customer count. The more customers Delhi acquires, the higher revenues it generates, giving a positive correlation.

Notably, the revenue generated from individuals in the 65+ age group exceeds that from the 51-65, 18-24, and 25-30 age groups. This is despite a lower customer count in the 65+ category, highlighting a unique and lucrative market.

The majority of all customers fall within the age group of 31-40, signifying a strong presence in this demographic.

## **Sales View:**
Our sales operations encompass four distinct modes: Offline Agent, Offline Direct, Online App, and Online Website.

Among our 26,841 customers, a significant portion—14,873 customers, to be precise—engaged with our services through the Offline Agent channel.

Noteworthy is the fact that 1.08% more customers opted for insurance through the Online App compared to the Offline Direct mode, indicating a preference for the convenience of digital transactions.

A substantial 55.56% of our revenue is attributed to the Offline Agent Sales mode, underscoring its impact on our overall financial performance.

Over the past six months, we have observed a positive trend in insurance sales through the Online App and Online Website channels. Conversely, there has been a decline in the sales performance of the Offline Direct Sales mode.

This strategic overview highlights the dynamics of our sales modes, emphasizing both successful channels and areas for potential improvement.

## **Age Group View:**
 The age range spanning from 31 to 40 holds the largest share of customers in our demographic, closely trailed by the 41-50 age group.

Within the 31-40 age group, there is a notable surge in insurance sales, with a higher volume of policies purchased compared to other age brackets.

Interestingly, the 18-24 and 51-60 age groups boast nearly identical customer counts. However, individuals in the 51-60 range exhibit a greater inclination toward purchasing insurance through Online Apps and Online Websites compared to their younger counterparts in the 18-24 age group.

A distinctive trend emerges in the 51-60 age group's customer count, which experiences a dip in April compared to other months. This decline amounts to a significant 65.48% reduction in customer numbers compared to the preceding month.

This analysis sheds light on the customer distribution across age groups, their purchasing behaviors, and a noteworthy fluctuation in customer count within the 51-60 age bracket during the month of April.
